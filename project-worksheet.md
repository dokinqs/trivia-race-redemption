### Functional Components

Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility?  
Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.  

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Show Intro | H | 3 |  | 
| Start Timer | H | 3 |  | 
| Show Random Trivia Questions and Answers | H | 11 |  | 
| Display Result | H | 3 |  | 
| Total |  | 20 hrs |  |

### Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enough that they can be reused in other applications. 

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string |
